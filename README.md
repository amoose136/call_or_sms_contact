<p> You can also mute/unmute and end calls. You can also accept or decline incoming calls too. These options can be invoked by the keywords "Mute", "End", and "Answer" or hotkeys. The "End" command will do all of the following: end a current call, decline an incoming call, and cancel a failed call attempt. </p>

<p><b>Known Issues:</b></p>

<p>
(This no longer appears to be an issue in macOS 10.15)
</p>

<p> macOS 10.14 - The "Mute" command will not reflect that the call is muted in the Notification Center window when invoked for the first time. If you invoke the command twice, then GUI will reflect the change (the "Mute" text color changes from gray to white). I believe this is an issue with Notification Center. </p>
